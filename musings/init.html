hi, this is me initiallizing the stuff. the 'version history' jazz is blantantly copied from <a href="http://bactra.org/notebooks/">shazili's notebooks</a>. one of the things i would love to do in the come period is to move to a 'dumb phone': one of those nokia keypad models and look what improve in the quality of life it brings. (read to combat the severe brainrot my generation has been suffering from.) the idea is to invest that idle time to maybe reading books, or consuming media— movies, shows or anime. we can only wait and watch.

22/7: i haven't switched to a keypad phone yet, but deactivated my instagram. started reading Calcutta Chromosome by Amitava Ghosh.

  <br>
27/9: my phone recntly stopped working, so i got a dumbphone: some nokia keypad phone. the screen just wouldn't respond. maybe it's a divine intervention; a great reset bestowed upon me by the greatest of non linearities. time has come to respond to my call to duty, and tackle the years of systematic brainrot and brain fog.
