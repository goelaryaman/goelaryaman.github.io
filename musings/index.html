  this is the place where i'll be putting up stuff which i wrote, thought or found interesting. some things may likely be in the form of maxims, or maybe some short pieces. the long form things will go to <a href="/blog">blogs</a>. <br>
  i firmly believe in the adage: information is might. it may sound quite totalitarian, but i hope not to see it in that sense. <br>
  talking about information, a lot of my views have been influenced by the phenomenal phenomenologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandip_Tiwari">Dr. Sandip Tiwari</a> is. he is a joy to talk with. he took a course for me in the monsoon semester of 2024 (which was my 3rd year,) and pushed our intellectual capabilities. he writes expectionally well and is wonderful person. you can read some of his stuff from a previous visit to iitk <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/scdt/Sandip_Tiwari_Kanpur_Lectures.html">here</a>
